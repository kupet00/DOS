# My personal DOSbox setup

This repository simply holds my bash script to select my games. It lists all the .conf files in the confs directory and you can select which one to start. This way, I can simply add conf files for each game, or several conf files for different settings (like seperate CGA and VGA setups for a game).

It relies on DOSBOX-X being installed as a flatpak for now.
